This game was made for a game jam [49 hours] for UNCC

All programming by me, and all art by Richard Wei

To install:
## Linux:

[Here is Rust's site on how to install](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/other-installers.html)

You need to get rustup and install a toolchain,

*I recommend rust-nightly*

You then just set it as your default toolchain

Then run `cargo build` in the main directory of this repository

It *should* install everything using the handy-dandy `Cargo.toml` file

## Windows:

Install rust from their [website](ttps://www.rust-lang.org)

Then open a CMD or whatever you want to use

Run `cargo build` in the main directory of this repository

It *should* install everything using the handy-dandy `Cargo.toml` file

# VERY IMPORTANT:

You **MUST** move the `resources/` file into the same directory as the binary!

By default, the binary is in the `target/debug/` directory. Just copy it there

Have fun! Made within 49 hours by two students at UNCC
